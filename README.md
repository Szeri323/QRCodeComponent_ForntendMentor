## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS custom properties
- Sass/scss precomipler

### What I learned

The main goal was to implement a solution using SCSS. 
After submitting the solution, I got a tip to refactor the properties to scss and learned how to use them as in the example below:

```scss
$color-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
$color-light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
$color-grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
$color-dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

body {
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    background-color: $color-light-gray;
}
```


### Continued development

I'm becoming more confident in coding simple frontend components, then I want to focus on more complex projects.
